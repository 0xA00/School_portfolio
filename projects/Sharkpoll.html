        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This project was the most important of our 2nd year, we had to develop an application using Elgamal encryption, so people can vote securely and anonymously.
        For this we had to create a scrutineer and a ballot box to encrypt the vote, aggregate them and decrypt them at the end when the poll is finished. The application
        had to use JavaFX. This semester, new tasks were brought up, we had to prevent malicious people to stuff the ballot box and  had to Dockerize the ballot box and the scrutineer.
        <br>It was very challenging and me and my team have surely learn new things as how to Dockerize an image and how to implement the Zero Proof Knowledge principle to prevent
        the ballot box being stuffed.</p>
